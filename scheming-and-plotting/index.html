      3. Create a form element with the attribute: method="plotScheme"
        - this is similar to onclick, plotScheme is the name of our js funciton
      4. Choose 5 html color names and enter them into the comments below
        - http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp

      TIP: We're creating 5 similar divs, to save time, try creating the first
      section (steps 5 to 8) and then copying and pasting it, changing the
      parts that are different for each one.
      5. inside the form, create 5 divs and give them each the class "color-choice"
      6. inside each div create an input element with these attributes:
        type="radio" name="color" value=
      7. after each input element, create a paragraph element
      8. in each section, choose a color from your list, and assign it to:
        - the id of the div
        - the value attribute of the input
        - the text of the paragraph element

      9. Create one more input with type="submit"
        - HTML forms always have a submit button to send the values entered
          into that form to the function we assigned in the method attribute
      CONTINUE MISSION IN css/scheme.css
